## Day 6: September 19, 2025
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to use persistent MySQL storage with `mysql_data` volume and set `user-service` port to 8080.

- Rebuilt and tested `user-service` in Docker, confirming registration, login, and JWT APIs work via Postman.
- Verified MySQL schema and data persistence.
- Pushed changes to GitHub.

## Day 7: September 20, 2025
- Fixed `JwtAuthenticationFilter` compilation error by updating imports from `javax.servlet` to `jakarta.servlet` to match Spring Boot 3.5.5.
- Fixed `AuthService` compilation errors by handling non-Optional `UserRepository.findByUsername` and converting `User.Role` enum to String.
- Fixed `user-service` startup error by adding `BCryptPasswordEncoder` bean in `SecurityConfig`.
- Removed test dependencies (`org.testng:testng`, `spring-boot-starter-test`) from `pom.xml` to eliminate Maven warnings.
- Added role-based access control to `user-service` by including user role in JWT token.
- Implemented `/users/me` endpoint to retrieve authenticated user's profile.
- Updated `SecurityConfig` to restrict `/users/me` to authenticated users.
- Tested registration, login, profile retrieval, and role-based access with Postman for different roles (`CUSTOMER`, `ADMIN`).
- Rebuilt and tested `user-service` in Docker, confirming all APIs work.
- Pushed changes to GitHub.

## Day 8: September 23, 2025
